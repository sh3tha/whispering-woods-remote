1. The Language of Ancient Runes: 
The Ancient Runes are luminous glyphs woven into the very fabric of time. Discovered only in places where reality thins-like Hollowmere Woods-they pulse with memory, responding to touch and song. Forgotten by most, these symbols reveal ancestral truths and open hidden paths to those with the blood-right to read them. 
 
2. The Griffin, Guardian of the Sky Peaks: 
The Griffin of Sky Peaks is a majestic sentinel, part eagle, part lion, with feathers that shimmer like stormlight. It watches from cragged heights, judging the worth of those who seek the Cipher. Only the brave and pure of purpose can pass, for its cry unravels the hearts of liars.
