Mira turned the key in the arch, and light burst through the woods like dawn breaking.
 The forest exhaled—its magic restored.The map unfolded in her hands, glowing with forgotten 
paths and sacred places.When she returned, Hollowmere changed. The fields bloomed, the wells 
ran clear, and the villagers no longer feared the woods.Mira, the girl who listened, had brought
 the forest back to life.And each night, under starlit skies, she hummed her father’s lullabies—songs that
 now belonged to a thriving, whispering world.
