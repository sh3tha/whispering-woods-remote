"Majestic and fierce, the Griffin soars above the Sky Peaks, its golden feathers shimmering under the sun. It guards ancient ruins and sacred knowledge, attacking intruders with razor talons. Revered by locals, the Griffin is a symbol of protection, wisdom, and the wild, untamed spirit of the mountains."
