"The Orb of Fleeting Moments is a shimmering amulet encased in silver filigree, holding a swirling mist within. When touched, it reveals brief, vivid visions of the past-no more than a minute-granting clarity or sorrow. Each use dims its glow, reminding wearers that memories are precious and fleeting."
